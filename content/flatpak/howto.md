# How to Make a `.sh` File Executable on Linux and macOS

Shell scripts (`.sh` files) are text files that contain commands you want your system to run. Before you can run a shell script directly, you often need to make it **executable**. This means telling your operating system that the file can be run as a program.

In this article, you’ll learn simple steps to make any `.sh` file executable on Linux or macOS.

## What is a `.sh` File?

A `.sh` file is a shell script—basically a list of commands written in a scripting language for the shell (like Bash). These commands can automate tasks, configure environments, or run programs.

---

## Step 1: Create or Locate Your `.sh` File

First, make sure you have your shell script ready. For example, create a simple script called `myscript.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, world!"
```

Save this file somewhere you can find it, like your home directory or desktop.

---

## Step 2: Open Your Terminal

You’ll need to use the terminal to make your `.sh` file executable.

- On **Linux**, open your Terminal application.
- On **macOS**, open the Terminal app from Applications > Utilities.

---

## Step 3: Navigate to the Script’s Directory

Use the `cd` command to go to the folder where your `.sh` file is located.

Example:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
```

If your script is on your desktop, this command will bring you there.

---

## Step 4: Make the Script Executable

Use the `chmod` command (short for “change mode”) to add execute permissions to your script:

```bash
chmod +x myscript.sh
```

This command adds the execute (`x`) permission to the file for your user account.

---

## Step 5: Run the Script

Now you can run your script directly:

```bash
./myscript.sh
```

If everything is correct, you should see:

```
Hello, world!
```

---

## Explanation: What Did We Just Do?

- `chmod +x myscript.sh`: The `+x` flag adds execute permission, meaning the system knows this file can be run as a program.
- `./myscript.sh`: The `./` means "run the file in the current directory." Without it, the system might not find your script.

---

## Optional: Check Permissions

To verify the file’s permissions, you can run:

```bash
ls -l myscript.sh
```

You should see something like:

```
-rwxr-xr-x  1 username  group  42 May 25 12:00 myscript.sh
```

The `x` in the permission string indicates the file is executable.

---

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Permission denied error?** Make sure you’ve run `chmod +x filename.sh`.
- **Command not found?** Ensure you run the script with `./` prefix if you’re in the same directory.
- **Wrong interpreter?** Confirm the first line (called a shebang) is correct. For Bash, it should be: `#!/bin/bash`

---

## Summary

To make a `.sh` file executable:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to your script’s folder.
3. Run `chmod +x filename.sh`.
4. Execute your script with `./filename.sh`.

Now you can automate tasks easily with shell scripts!
