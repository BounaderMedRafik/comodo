## Syntax

```bash
cd [directory]
```

## Common Usages

### Go to a directory

```bash
cd /path/to/directory
```

### Go to the home directory

```bash
cd
```

or

```bash
cd ~
```

### Move one directory up

```bash
cd ..
```

### Move up two levels

```bash
cd ../..
```

### Use absolute vs relative paths

- Absolute path:

  ```bash
  cd /usr/local/bin
  ```

- Relative path:
  ```bash
  cd ../Documents
  ```

## Tips

- Use `cd -` to switch to the previous directory.
- `cd` alone brings you to your home directory.
