## 1. Introduction

**Arch Linux** is a lightweight and flexible Linux distribution that adheres to the _KISS_ principle (_Keep It Simple, Stupid_). It is targeted at advanced users who prefer full control over their system's setup and configuration.

Unlike user-friendly distributions like Ubuntu or Fedora, Arch offers a **minimal base system** that the user builds upon manually. This makes it an excellent choice for those who want to learn the inner workings of Linux and configure their system from the ground up.

## 2. Features

- **Rolling Release**: Continuous updates with the latest software versions.
- **Pacman Package Manager**: Simple and powerful package management.
- **AUR (Arch User Repository)**: Vast community-driven software repository.
- **Minimalist Philosophy**: Only install what you need.
- **Arch Wiki**: One of the most comprehensive Linux documentation sources.
- **Systemd-based**: Uses systemd for init and service management.
- **No GUI Installer**: Setup is done manually via command line (although community installers exist).

## 3. Editions & Variants

Arch Linux officially offers **one variant**—a minimal base installation. However, several community distributions are based on Arch:

| Variant       | Description                                     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Arch Linux    | Official base installation (DIY)                |
| EndeavourOS   | Arch-based with user-friendly installer         |
| Manjaro Linux | User-friendly Arch-based distro                 |
| ArchBang      | Pre-configured Openbox setup on Arch            |
| Artix Linux   | Arch without systemd (uses OpenRC, runit, etc.) |

These community projects provide a gentler learning curve while retaining the core benefits of Arch.

## 4. System Requirements

**Minimum:**

- x86_64-compatible processor
- 512MB RAM
- 2GB disk space

**Recommended:**

- 2GB+ RAM
- 10GB+ disk space
- Network connectivity for installation

Arch is extremely lightweight and can run on older hardware with the right configuration.

## 5. Installation Guide

> **Note**: This is a simplified guide. Refer to the [official Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide) for full details.

### 1. Download ISO

- Get the latest ISO from [https://archlinux.org/download](https://archlinux.org/download)

### 2. Create Bootable Media

Use tools like:

- **Rufus** (Windows)
- **Etcher** or `dd` (Linux/macOS)

### 3. Boot into Live Environment

- Select “Boot Arch Linux (x86_64)”
- Connect to the internet (use `iwctl` or `wifi-menu` if using Wi-Fi)

### 4. Partition and Mount

Use tools like `cfdisk`, `fdisk`, or `parted` to partition your disk. Then mount your partitions:

```bash
mount /dev/sdXn /mnt
```

### 5. Install Base System

```bash
pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware
```

### 6. Configure the System

```bash
genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
arch-chroot /mnt
```

Set timezone, locale, hostname, install a bootloader (GRUB), and create a user.

### 7. Reboot and Configure

```bash
exit
umount -R /mnt
reboot
```

Log in and begin building your environment (e.g., install a desktop environment).

## 6. Post-Installation Checklist

- Install network manager:

  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S networkmanager
  sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager
  ```

- Install essential packages:

  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S base-devel git sudo
  ```

- Install your DE/WM:

  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S xorg gnome gnome-tweaks gdm
  sudo systemctl enable gdm
  ```

- Enable Multilib (for 32-bit support):

  ```ini
  # /etc/pacman.conf
  [multilib]
  Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
  ```

  Then run: `sudo pacman -Syu`

## 7. Package Management

### Pacman Commands

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu               # Update system
sudo pacman -S <package>       # Install package
sudo pacman -R <package>       # Remove package
sudo pacman -Ss <keyword>      # Search package
```

### AUR (Arch User Repository)

Install AUR helper like **yay**:

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay && makepkg -si
```

Then use:

```bash
yay -S <aur-package>
```

## 10. Tips & Best Practices

- Regularly update your system (`sudo pacman -Syu`)
- Always read **/etc/pacman.conf** before enabling repositories
- Use the **Arch Wiki** before asking questions—it’s extremely thorough
- Backup your system before major changes
- Consider a virtual machine first if you’re new to Arch
- Avoid blindly using AUR packages—review PKGBUILDs for safety
