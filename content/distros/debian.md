Debian is available in three main branches, each intended for different types of users:

## 7. Package Management

Debian uses the **APT** (Advanced Package Tool) system.

### APT Commands

```bash
sudo apt update                # Update package lists
sudo apt upgrade               # Upgrade all packages
sudo apt install <package>     # Install a package
sudo apt remove <package>      # Remove a package
```

### dpkg (Low-level tool)

```bash
sudo dpkg -i <package>.deb     # Install a local .deb file
```

Debian has no GUI package manager by default, but tools like **Synaptic** or **GNOME Software** can be installed.
